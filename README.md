# Raspberry-Pi-Automated-Assembly-Line
Raspberry Pi 3 with OpenCV used for image processing of a jig-saw puzzle. Once the jig-saw puzzle was analyzed a serial robotic arm(Dobot) would move the puzzle pieces to a conveyor belt where they would move towards a Delta robot that would place each puzzle piece in its designated location.
