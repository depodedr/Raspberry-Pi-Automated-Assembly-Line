# Raspberry-Pi-Automated-Assembly-Line
Raspberry Pi 3 with OpenCV used for image processing of a jig-saw puzzle. Once the jig-saw puzzle was analyzed a serial robotic arm(Dobot) would move the puzzle pieces to a conveyor belt where they would move towards a Delta robot that would place each puzzle piece in its designated location.

Contained within the Zip folder is all the code that is required for this project. Everything from the image recognition in OpenCV to the kinematics of both robots
